# Redbus_Project
The "Redbus Data Scraping with Selenium &amp; Dynamic Filtering using Streamlit" project automates bus travel data collection using Selenium, stores it in a SQL database, and enables interactive filtering via a Streamlit app. Users can filter data like bus routes, prices, and seat availability for analysis and decision-making.
